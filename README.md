# Overview

Suafe is a Subversion User Authorization File Editor, which does exactly what the name implies. It is a Java Swing GUI application that helps with editing of authz files. Suafe also has comprehensive command line options that allow it to be used via scripts to modify and query authz files for information.

# Next Steps

Suafe has been around and used for a few years, but new features are on the way. Adding support for aliases is on the top of the list, as is separating the authz file parsing/generation code into a separate library. There have been numerous requests to separate the file handing code to a reusable library. These two features are currently being worked on.
