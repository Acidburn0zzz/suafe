<h1>Groups Tab</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The Groups Tab consists of three sections. The far left list displays all 
current defined groups. The upper right section displays all members of the
currently selected group. The lower right section displays all access rules 
that reference the currently selected group. Selecting a different group
automatically refreshes the two right sections.

<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>
Located group list are the group action buttons. Clicking on Add
allows you to add another group. Clicking edit displays the edit screen for all
currently selected groups. Clicking delete deletes all currently selected 
groups.
</p>

<p>
Below the group members list is the Add/Remove Members action button. This
allows you to add and remove members from the selected groups.
</p>

<p>
Double-clicking on a group in the group list displays the edit screen for the
selected group. Double-clicking on a member name in the member list displays
the member. Selected groups and group details are displayed in the Groups tab
and users and user details are displayed in the 
<a href="users_tab.html">Users Tab</a>.
</p>

<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>
Groups with no members and groups that are not referenced are persisted.
</p>

<p>
Deleting a group also deletes all access rules that reference that group. Group
members are not deleted.
